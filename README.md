# BeatScabbard

This is a desktop app for managing custom Beat Saber songs. 
A large reason I'm writing this app is to learn/try out JetBrains Compose.
Another reason is that there's not a straightforward way of deleting downloaded songs short of browsing to the directory 
manually and deleting the folder.

## Current Features
- [x] Listing songs in the custom songs directory (currently the path is hardcoded)
- [x] A button for each song to open the directory in the OS' default file explorer

## Planned Features
- [ ] Automatic detection of custom songs directory
- [ ] Deleting songs (potentially with the ability to undo)

I'll likely add more stuff as I go once I get more comfortable with Compose.
